### CPSC 120

*  Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 3 was my favorite because I coded my first game.The game was a two-player number guessing game. It was the first time using if-loops.I spent hours coding and debugging. To the point of giving up but managed to make it work.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was interesting to me. I was curious how programs work with external files. I was able to open a file. Then I coded a function that read the message from the user and stored it in the user file.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was fun as I created a gradient image. In this lab I used two files .h and .cc to create the image. I used two for-loops to determine the color for columns and rows. Then output the image as a file.
